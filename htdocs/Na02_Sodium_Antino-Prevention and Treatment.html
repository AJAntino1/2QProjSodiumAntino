                <h1>Prevention and Treatment of Covid-19</h1>
            <p> Protect yourself and people around you by knowing the facts and taking appropriate precautions 
                and advice prodvided by your local health authority in your area.
                Covid-19 tends to spread more easily in situations where people are in a close proximity area 
                with one another for long periods of time. Indoor locations, especially with poor ventilation
                , are much riskier than outdoor locations. Activies where there's more droplets expelled from
                the mouth such as sighing or breathing heavily in the exericse can also increase the risk of
                transmission.So to prevent and minimize the spread of Covid-19, we need to take safety precautions 
                such as wearing a mask and face shield when going outside. We also need to maintain a safe distance 
                from each other (that is atleast 1 meter), and choose to go on open and well-ventilated spaces. 
                Clean your hands often with soap and wtaer or an alcohol-based hand rub if you're outside. And 
                lastly, get vaccinated when it's your turn because it would help protect you and the people around 
                us. Getting vaccinated also minimizes the effects of Covid-19 on a person so it would just feel 
                like a normal flu instead of a deadly coronavirus.
