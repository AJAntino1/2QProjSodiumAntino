                <h1>The Different Variants of Covid-19</h1>
                <p>The 5 main variants of concern are the Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, and Omicron. All of these variants have different degree of effect and symptoms on the people that get infected. Some and deadlier but is much harder to spread and some and easily transmissible but only cause mild or moderate symptoms/</p>

                <p>The Alpha variant is the 2nd variant of concern to appear and its first detected on United Kingdom on September 2020. Its common symptoms are chills, lost of appetite, and Headaches. It is more transmissible compared than the original type of Covid-19 because of its mutation on the spike protein which makes it easier for the virus to infiltrate a host cell.</p>

                <p>The Beta variant is the 1st variant of concern that got discovered and its first detected on South Africa in May 2020. Its symptoms are the same with the original Covid-19 virus and other variants. However the Beta variant contains mutations that allows it to bind more easily on humans and evade some of the antibodies in our immune system.</p>

                <p>The Gamma variant is the 4th variant of concern that was discovered and its first detected on Japan and Brazil in November 2020. its symptoms are also similar to the original Covid-19 virus but its more transmissible and less deadly compared to the other variants.</p>

                <p>The Delta variant is the 3rd variant of concern that was discovered. It was first detected from India in October 2020 and its symptoms are headaches, sore throat, runny nose, and fever. This variant is more transmissible compared to the 3 other variants discussed before (Alpha, Beta, And Gamma), it is also a lot deadlier than the other variants as it can cause more sever cases of Covid-19.</p>

                <p>And lastly, the Omicron variant is the 5th variant of the concern that got discoevered and it was first detected at South African in November 2021. Its symptoms are Body aches, Fatigue, Cough, and many more. The Omicron variant is the most transmissible variant out of all of them but it only cause mild to moderate symptoms.</p>
